# Polyanya

Polyanya is a compromise-free pathfinding algorithm over navigation meshes (Read the paper [here](http://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/0070.pdf).)
The implementation of Polyanya can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/mlcui1/polyanya).

# Replicating our experiments
0. `make fast` compile and get executable
1. prepare data, `ln -s <meshes> . && ln -s <polys> .`
2. `./gen_pts.sh` generate target set;
3. `./gen_test.sh` generate input files;
4. `./gen_run.sh` generate scripts for experiments (dense and sparse);
5. `./s1run.sh` (generated by step 3) run dense experiment;
6. `./s2run.sh` (generated by step 3) run sparse experiment;
7. logs are stored in `output/{s1,s2}/*.log`.
